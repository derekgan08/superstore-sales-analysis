# Principles of Data Analytics Assignment 2: SuperStore Sales Analysis

## Project Overview
This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the **SuperStore Sales dataset**, which includes sales, profit, customer segments, product categories, and geographic data. The main goal of the analysis is to uncover insights related to customer segmentation, product category distributions, geographic patterns, and other business trends.

The analysis is done using the **R programming language**, and various data processing, cleaning, and visualization techniques are applied to derive insights from the dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a sample SuperStore sales dataset that includes details on product sales, profits, customers, and geographic data. This dataset can be found at: ![SuperStoreOrders.csv](SuperStoreOrders.csv)

## Data Preprocessing and Cleaning
1.  **Load and Inspect Data:**  
    The dataset is loaded into R, and the variables are inspected for inconsistencies in data types. The variables are then converted to their appropriate data types.

2.  **Data Cleaning:**  
    Unnecessary or irrelevant variables are removed, and missing or inconsistent data points are handled to ensure accurate analysis.

    **Updated Names and Data Types for Columns in Data Frame:**

3.  **Top 1000 Instances:**  
    After data cleaning, only the top 1000 records are retained for further analysis, ensuring that the dataset remains manageable and focused.

## Insights and Visualizations
1.  **Customer Segments & Product Categories:**  
    Customers are grouped based on segments, and the distribution of product categories within each segment is visualized.

    **Bar Chart of The Category Distribution for Each of The Customer Segments:**

    </p>
    Notice that, the office supplies is the most popular category among all customer segments, followed by technology category. Other than that, consumer segment is the majority of the customerâ€™s segment.

2.  **Top 10 Product Categories:**  
    A ranking of the top 10 most frequently sold product categories based on sales and profit data is presented. The top 10 sub-categories are Binders, storage, art, phones, chairs, paper, furnishings, labels, fasteners, and machines.

    **Bar Chart of The Frequency of Different Sub-Categories:**

3.  **Subcategory Insights:**  
    For each product category, the 3 most frequently bought subcategories are identified and visualized. The 3 most frequent-bought sub-categories for furniture are bookcases, chairs, and furnishings. The 3 most frequent-bought sub-categories for office supplies are binders, art, and storage. The 3 most frequent-bought sub-categories for technology are phones, machines, and have same frequency for accessories and copiers.
